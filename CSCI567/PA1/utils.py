    Please follow this link to know more about min max scaling

    You should keep some states inside the object.
    You can assume that the parameter of the first __call__
    will be the training set.

    Hints:
        1. Use a variable to check for first __call__ and only compute
            and store min/max in that case.

        1. You may assume the parameters are valid when __call__
